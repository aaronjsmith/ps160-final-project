        <h2>Global Position and Weather Patterns</h2>
        
        <section class="my-8 rounded-lg border border-stone-200 bg-white p-6">
          <p>
            Arizona's location between approximately <strong>31°20'N and 37°N</strong> latitude places it within the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, significantly influencing its weather patterns and climate systems.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Global Circulation Cells</h3>
          <p>
            Arizona is primarily influenced by the <strong>Ferrel Cell</strong>, which operates between 30° and 60° latitude. The state's southern regions experience the descending limb of the Hadley Cell around 30°N, which contributes to the arid conditions characteristic of the Sonoran Desert. This descending air creates high-pressure systems that suppress precipitation, resulting in Arizona's low annual rainfall. The Ferrel Cell's westerly winds bring weather systems from the Pacific Ocean, though much of the moisture is lost to orographic lifting over California's mountain ranges before reaching Arizona.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Global Precipitation Patterns</h3>
          <p>
            Arizona's precipitation patterns are heavily influenced by its position relative to global circulation cells. The state receives most of its precipitation during two distinct seasons: winter storms from the Pacific (November-March) and the North American Monsoon (July-September). The monsoon season occurs when the Intertropical Convergence Zone shifts northward, bringing moist air from the Gulf of California and Gulf of Mexico. This seasonal pattern results in a bimodal precipitation distribution, with most areas receiving between 3-15 inches of annual precipitation, though higher elevations can receive up to 30 inches.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Wind Belt Systems</h3>
          <p>
            Arizona lies within the <strong>Westerlies wind belt</strong>, where prevailing winds move from west to east. However, the state's complex topography, including the Mogollon Rim, Colorado Plateau, and Basin and Range Province, creates local wind patterns that modify these global systems. During the summer monsoon, surface heating creates thermal low-pressure systems that draw in moist air from the south, reversing typical wind patterns. These wind systems contribute to Arizona's characteristic weather patterns, including the development of haboobs (dust storms) and the distribution of precipitation across the state's varied elevations.

        <h2>Severe Weather</h2>
        
        <section class="my-8 rounded-lg border border-stone-200 bg-white p-6">
          <p>
            Arizona experiences several types of severe weather, though the state is less prone to hurricanes and tornadoes compared to other regions. The most common severe weather events include:
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Monsoon Storms and Flash Floods</h3>
          <p>
            The North American Monsoon brings intense thunderstorms that can produce torrential rainfall, leading to dangerous flash floods. One notable example occurred in July 2021, when heavy monsoon rains caused severe flooding in Flagstaff and surrounding areas, resulting in evacuations and significant property damage. The 2014 flash flood in Phoenix's Loop 101 area stranded motorists and caused extensive damage, demonstrating the rapid onset and destructive power of these events.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Dust Storms (Haboobs)</h3>
          <p>
            Arizona is famous for its haboobs—massive dust storms that can reach heights of 3,000 feet and travel at speeds up to 60 miles per hour. These storms typically occur during the monsoon season when strong downdrafts from thunderstorms kick up dust and sand. A particularly severe haboob in July 2011 swept through Phoenix, reducing visibility to near zero and causing numerous traffic accidents. These storms pose significant health risks due to particulate matter and can cause respiratory problems.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Wildfires</h3>
          <p>
            Wildfires are a major concern in Arizona, particularly in forested areas of the north and central regions. The 2011 Wallow Fire, which burned over 538,000 acres in eastern Arizona, was the largest wildfire in state history. More recently, the 2022 Pipeline Fire near Flagstaff burned over 26,000 acres and forced evacuations. These fires are often exacerbated by prolonged drought, high temperatures, and strong winds, creating conditions that challenge firefighting efforts.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Extreme Heat</h3>
          <p>
            While not a traditional "storm," extreme heat is Arizona's deadliest weather phenomenon. Phoenix regularly experiences temperatures exceeding 110°F during summer months, with the city recording its hottest summer on record in 2020. Heat-related deaths are a persistent public health concern, particularly affecting vulnerable populations. The urban heat island effect exacerbates temperatures in metropolitan areas.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Tornadoes</h3>
          <p>
            While less common than in the central United States, Arizona does experience tornadoes, typically weak (EF0-EF1) and associated with monsoon thunderstorms. Most occur in the eastern and central parts of the state during the summer months. A notable exception was the EF2 tornado that struck Flagstaff in October 2010, causing significant damage to Northern Arizona University.

        <h2>Climate Classification</h2>
        
        <section class="my-8 rounded-lg border border-stone-200 bg-white p-6">
          <p>
            According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Arizona contains multiple climate types due to its diverse topography and elevation range:
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">BWh - Hot Desert Climate</h3>
          <p>
            The majority of southern and western Arizona, including Phoenix and Yuma, experiences a <strong>hot desert climate (BWh)</strong>. This climate is characterized by extremely hot summers with average high temperatures often exceeding 100°F, mild winters, and very low annual precipitation (typically less than 10 inches). The Sonoran Desert, which covers much of this region, is one of the hottest and driest deserts in North America.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">BSk - Cold Semi-Arid Climate</h3>
          <p>
            Northern and eastern Arizona, including Flagstaff and the Colorado Plateau, feature a <strong>cold semi-arid climate (BSk)</strong>. This climate type experiences greater temperature variation, with warm summers and cold winters. Precipitation is still relatively low (10-20 inches annually) but higher than desert regions. Snow is common in winter months at higher elevations.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Csa - Hot-Summer Mediterranean Climate</h3>
          <p>
            Small areas in the higher elevations of central Arizona, particularly around the Mogollon Rim, exhibit characteristics of a <strong>hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa)</strong>. These regions experience dry summers and wetter winters, with moderate temperatures year-round compared to surrounding desert areas.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Dfb - Warm-Summer Humid Continental Climate</h3>
          <p>
            The highest elevations in northern Arizona, including the San Francisco Peaks near Flagstaff, feature a <strong>warm-summer humid continental climate (Dfb)</strong>. These alpine areas experience four distinct seasons, with cold, snowy winters and mild summers. Annual precipitation can exceed 25 inches, much of it falling as snow.
          </p>
          
          <div class="mt-6 mb-4">

        <h2>Biomes</h2>
        
        <section class="my-8 rounded-lg border border-stone-200 bg-white p-6">
          <p>
            Arizona's diverse topography and climate create several distinct biomes, each supporting unique ecosystems and species:
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Sonoran Desert</h3>
          <p>
            The <strong>Sonoran Desert</strong> covers approximately one-third of Arizona, primarily in the southern and western regions. This is the most biologically diverse desert in North America, characterized by iconic saguaro cacti, palo verde trees, and creosote bushes. The biome supports a remarkable array of specialized plants and animals adapted to extreme heat and aridity. The Sonoran Desert has historically united communities through shared water management challenges and agricultural practices, while also creating divisions between urban areas and rural desert communities over resource allocation.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Colorado Plateau</h3>
          <p>
            The <strong>Colorado Plateau</strong> biome in northern Arizona features high-elevation grasslands, pinyon-juniper woodlands, and ponderosa pine forests. This biome includes the Grand Canyon and supports diverse wildlife including elk, mule deer, and numerous bird species. The plateau's unique geology and ecosystems have created a strong sense of regional identity, particularly around conservation and tourism, while also highlighting tensions between resource extraction industries and environmental protection.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Mogollon Rim and Coniferous Forests</h3>
          <p>
            The <strong>Mogollon Rim</strong> region transitions between desert and forest biomes, featuring mixed coniferous forests dominated by ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, and aspen. This biome provides critical watershed functions and supports logging and recreation industries. The forests have historically united communities through shared fire management concerns, while creating divisions between environmental groups and timber industries.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Chaparral and Grasslands</h3>
          <p>
            Central and southeastern Arizona contain <strong>chaparral</strong> and <strong>grassland</strong> biomes, characterized by drought-resistant shrubs and native grasses. These areas support ranching and agriculture while providing habitat for diverse wildlife. These biomes have fostered agricultural communities but also created conflicts over water rights and land use between urban and rural interests.
          </p>
          
          <p class="mt-4">
            <strong>Social Impact:</strong> Arizona's biomes have both united and divided society. The shared challenge of water scarcity has united communities in developing innovative water management strategies, while differences in resource needs between desert cities and forest communities have created political and economic divisions. The state's biomes also contribute to a strong sense of regional identity, with residents identifying strongly with their local ecosystems.

          <p>
            Arizona is home to 13 species of <strong>rattlesnakes</strong>, including the western diamondback, Mojave, and black-tailed rattlesnakes. These venomous snakes can deliver potentially fatal bites, though deaths are rare with modern medical treatment. Rattlesnakes play important roles in controlling rodent populations and are generally not aggressive unless threatened.

          <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-4">Arizona Bark Scorpion (Centruroides sculpturatus)</h4>
          <p>
            The <strong>Arizona bark scorpion</strong> is the most venomous scorpion in North America. Its sting causes intense pain, numbness, and in rare cases, can be life-threatening to children, the elderly, or those with compromised immune systems. These scorpions are common in urban areas and are well-adapted to human environments.

          <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-4">Black Widow Spider (Latrodectus hesperus)</h4>
          <p>
            The <strong>western black widow spider</strong> is found throughout Arizona. While bites are rarely fatal, they can cause severe muscle cramps, nausea, and difficulty breathing. These spiders are generally reclusive and only bite when threatened.

          <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-4">Mountain Lion (Puma concolor)</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Mountain lions</strong> (also called cougars or pumas) are large predators found throughout Arizona's mountainous and desert regions. While attacks on humans are rare, they can be dangerous, particularly to children and pets. These animals require large territories and can come into conflict with expanding human development.
