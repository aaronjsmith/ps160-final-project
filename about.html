        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <h2>My Ties to Arizona</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Arizona as a kid. My great-great-grandfather, Lot Smith, was asked by Brigham Young to help settle Sunset Valley near Mormon Lake. After he was killed, 6 months before my great-grandfather was born, he married his 9th wife, Diantha. After Lot's death, she moved to Thatcher. Since then, for several generations, the smiths resided there.. Growing up in Arizona, we dealt with an Arid climate where we had to be conscious of water use and various desert wildlife such as rattlesnakes and scorpions, which were abundant on my family's horse ranch.</p>
        <h2>Interesting Physical Geography</h2>
        <p>The Grand Canyon is the largest canyon in the world, and is a popular tourist destination. It is 277 miles long, 18 miles wide, and 1 mile deep. It was carved by the Colorado River over millions of years.</p>
        <h2>Reflection: Alma 30:44</h2>
        <blockquote>All things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator. — Alma 30:44</blockquote>
        <p>The Earth was formed through numerous natural processes that took millions, if not billions, of years to achieve. For example, the Grand Canyon was formed by the Green River slowly carving it out over millions of years. If god is willing to take millions of years to build the world's largest canyon with a small river, how long is he willing to form us until we are celestial like he is?  I believe everything that puts our earth in just the right spot in the solar system easily testifies to the hands of the divine.</p>
        <h2>Planned Media</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Short video reflection (1–2 minutes)</li>
          <li>A curated set of maps and satellite images</li>
          <li>Links to reputable brief documentaries or podcasts</li>
        </ul>
