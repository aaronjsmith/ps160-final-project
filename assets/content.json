        "body": "I grew up in Arizona as a kid. My great-great-grandfather, Lot Smith, was asked by Brigham Young to help settle Sunset Valley near Mormon Lake. After he was killed, 6 months before my great-grandfather was born, he married his 9th wife, Diantha. After Lot’s death, she moved to Thatcher. Since then, for several generations, the smiths resided there.. Growing up in Arizona, we dealt with an Arid climate where we had to be conscious of water use and various desert wildlife such as rattlesnakes and scorpions, which were abundant on my family's horse ranch."
